IMF Executive Board Concludes the 2024 Article IV
Consultation with Qatar
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Washington, DC – February 11, 2025: On January 27, 2025, the Executive Board of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation 1 with Qatar.
Growth normalization after the 2022 FIFA World Cup continued, with signs of strengthening
activities more recently. Real GDP growth is projected to improve gradually to 2 percent in
2024–25 supported by public investment, spillovers from the ongoing LNG expansion project,
and strong tourism. Medium-term growth is expected to accelerate to 4¾ percent on average,
boosted by the significant LNG production expansion and initial gains from implementing
reforms guided by the Third National Development Strategy (NDS3). Headline inflation will
likely ease to 1 percent in 2024 and converge to around 2 percent over the medium term.
With lower hydrocarbon prices, both the current account and fiscal surpluses narrowed in
2023, to 17 percent of GDP and 5½ percent of GDP, respectively. The twin surpluses
moderated further in 2024. Over the medium, as Qatar’s LNG production expands massively,
both the current and fiscal accounts will likely remain in surpluses, albeit declining as a share
of GDP, as hydrocarbon prices are projected to fall.
Banks are well-capitalized, liquid, and profitable, with the capital adequacy ratio of close to
20 percent and return on equity of 14½ percent, respectively, in the third quarter of 2024.
Since the implementation of QCB measures to reduce banks’ net short-term foreign liabilities,
banks’ non-resident deposits declined significantly, and banks have lengthened the average
maturity and diversified further the sources of foreign funding. The sector-wide NPL ratio
remained broadly unchanged at slightly below 4 percent and the provisioning coverage ratio is
relatively high at above 80 percent.
Qatar has started to implement the ambitious Third National Development Strategy (NDS3) to
build a more diversified, knowledge-based and private sector-driven economy. Guided by
NDS3, reform momentum has strengthened significantly, including to attract and retain highskilled expatriate workers, foster innovation, promote public-private partnerships, and further
improve the business efficiency. Qatar is well positioned to leverage digitalization and AI for
productivity gains, and the nation’s climate agenda is advancing.
Risks to the outlook are broadly balanced. Main downside risks stem from the global
headwinds, including a sharper-than-expected global growth slowdown, increased volatility in
global financial conditions and commodity prices, and further worsening of geopolitical
tensions. The regional conflict has had limited impact on Qatar but adds further to the
downside risks through lower tourism and capital inflows, and more volatile hydrocarbon

prices. Domestic downside risk stems mainly from further weaknesses in the real estate
sector, although strong tourism and policy measures introduced in 2023 could mitigate the
risk. Over the medium and long term, supply in the global natural gas market is expected to
expand significantly, potentially putting downward pressure on prices. On the upside,
sustained high hydrocarbon prices and accelerated NDS3 reforms would strengthen the
outlook. However, if ambitious NDS3 initiatives lead to resource misallocation, both the public
finance and growth prospect would be affected.
Executive Board Assessment 2
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They welcomed Qatar’s
continued resilience to external shocks and its favorable medium-term outlook, driven by
significant increases in LNG production and the reforms under the Third National
Development Strategy. Directors agreed that maintaining prudent macroeconomic policies and
accelerating reform efforts would further solidify macroeconomic stability and resilience to
shocks while boosting prosperity.
Directors commended the authorities’ commitment to continued fiscal prudence and called for
accelerating fiscal reforms. They recommended adopting a medium-term fiscal anchor to help
ensure intergenerational equity, and reiterated the need to accelerate revenue diversification,
particularly by introducing the value-added tax. Directors highlighted the importance of
improving spending efficiency and composition, particularly by enhancing public investment
management. They welcomed the ongoing efforts to strengthen fiscal institutions and adopt a
full-fledged medium-term fiscal framework with enhanced fiscal risk management.
Directors supported the authorities’ efforts to maintain financial stability and deepen domestic
financial markets, while encouraging them to consider undertaking a Financial Sector
Assessment Program update. They welcomed the newly introduced risk-based supervision
and recommended formalizing the financial safety net and continuing to adjust
macroprudential policies to mitigate potential macro-financial risks. Directors encouraged the
authorities to sustain their progress in fighting financial crimes.
Directors agreed that the exchange rate peg continues to serve Qatar well. They concurred
that, as conditions allow, strengthening the operational framework would further enhance
monetary policy transmission.
Directors supported the authorities’ strategy to build a more diversified, private sector-led, and
knowledge-based economy. They recommended fostering innovation and business efficiency
and enhancing human capital by attracting and retaining more high-skilled expatriate workers,
improving Qatari nationals’ employment in the private sector, and further increasing female
labor force participation. Directors agreed that aligning domestic energy prices with export
prices would benefit public finances and support climate goals. They also encouraged the
authorities to close remaining data gaps, with the help of IMF capacity development.

2 At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chair of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and

this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summing up can be found here:

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2024 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context: Growth normalization after the 2022 FIFA World Cup continued with signs of
activities strengthening more recently. Fiscal and external surpluses softened mainly due to
lower hydrocarbon prices. Banks are healthy but pockets of vulnerabilities remain. Reform
momentum has strengthened, guided by the Third National Development Strategy (NDS3).
Outlook and risks: Near-term growth is expected to strengthen gradually. The mediumterm outlook is more favorable, bolstered by massive LNG production expansion and
reform gains. Fiscal and external surpluses will likely remain but moderate. Qatar has so far
been resilient to the regional conflict, with risks to the outlook being balanced overall.
Qatar’s strong policy buffers can help mitigate the impact of adverse shocks.
Fiscal policy: The authorities’ commitment to continued fiscal prudence is welcome. The
positive outlook provides an opportunity to accelerate revenue diversification including to
introduce a value-added tax and broaden the corporate income tax, enhance spending
efficiency and gradually align domestic energy prices with export prices, and reorient
spending to enable private sector-driven growth. Adopting a full-fledged medium-term
fiscal framework, anchored by the benchmark to ensure intergenerational equity, will
enhance fiscal sustainability while securing priority spending. Greater fiscal transparency
and risk management, including on Public-Private Partnerships, will support the strategy.
Monetary and financial sector policies: The currency peg continues to serve the country
well. Efforts to strengthen liquidity management are welcome and should be guided by the
recent IMF technical assistance. Continued diligence to safeguard financial stability and
formalizing the financial safety net are critical. Promoting more stable domestic funding
through market deepening initiatives would help reduce banks’ exposure to short-term
foreign funding. Strong efforts to improve AML/CFT effectiveness should continue.
Structural reforms: Successful NDS3 implementation requires proper reform prioritization
and inter-agency coordination. Priorities include to enhance human capital and innovation,
promote trade diversification and FDI (with domestic knowledge spillovers) and further
improve business efficiency, especially access to finance. Qatar is well positioned to
leverage digitalization and AI for productivity gains. Accelerating climate actions can
strengthen sustainability and generate “green” growth. Policies targeting specific sectors or
economic zones should be managed carefully. Statistics should continue to improve.

CONTEXT
1.
Qatar has started the implementation of the much anticipated Third National
Development Strategy (NDS3) to chart a new course for economic transformation (Text
Figure 1). Driven by significant public infrastructure investment over the last decade, Qatar’s nonhydrocarbon economy has grown to account for about two-thirds of the total output. Diversification
in fiscal revenue and exports, however, has progressed more slowly. The trend decline in total factor
productivity has also been a drag to economic growth. Acknowledging these challenges, NDS3
(launched in January 2024) calls for a decisive transition from the costly state-driven growth model
to a private sector-led one, with the state becoming an enabler. NDS3 is reform-focused, aiming to
build a more sustainable and knowledge-based economy, with ambitious targets set and
“diversification clusters” identified to build comparative advantages (Annex I). Reform momentum
has strengthened significantly since the launch of NDS3.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
2.
Growth normalization after the 2022 FIFA World Cup continued with signs of a gradual
rebound more recently (Figure 1 and Text Figure 2). Real GDP growth declined from 4.2 percent in
2022 (where World Cup-related activities lifted non-hydrocarbon growth to 5.7 percent) to
1.2 percent in 2023 (with non-hydrocarbon growth at 1.1 percent as construction activities contracted
and services growth moderated). Tourism rose significantly since the World Cup, with visitor arrivals
rising 60 percent from 2022 to 2023. Real GDP growth strengthened gradually to an average of
1.4 percent (year on year) in the first three quarters of 2024, supported by non-hydrocarbon growth
of 2.9 percent. The peak tourist arrivals during the 2024 soccer Asian Cup (January–February)
exceeded those during the World Cup. The population continued to rise and employment reached a
record high. Recent PMI readings were mostly in the expansionary territory—with new orders and
employment particularly strong—benefitting from public investment and the ongoing North Field
LNG expansion project. The non-hydrocarbon output gap is estimated to be close to zero.

Inflation continued to moderate amid the growth normalization and tighter monetary
policy (Figure 2 and Text Figure 3). Headline inflation declined from 5 percent in 2022 to 3.0 percent
in 2023 (period average). It decelerated further to 1.2 percent in 2024 through October as rent and
recreation services inflation weakened. Producer price and wage inflation remained contained.

Domestic financial conditions tightened, while monetary policy easing started in
September 2024 (Figure 2 and Text Figure 4). The QCB continued to follow the US Federal Reserve
in setting policy rates and improved liquidity management through calibrated T-bill issuance. As
hydrocarbon prices moderated, the associated liquidity to the banking sector decreased. Bank
lending to domestic private sector eased to 5 percent (year-on-year) in 2023 while credit to the
public sector contracted after major World Cup-related infrastructure projects were completed.
Domestic credit accelerated in 2024 so far as private credit to services and trade strengthened, and
positive public credit growth resumed to support investment projects. Credit to the real estate
sector contracted (year-on-year) earlier in 2024 but grew from August.
5.
The current account surplus narrowed mainly on lower hydrocarbon prices (Figure 3
and Text Figure 5). The current account surplus shrank from 27 percent of GDP in 2022 to a still
sizeable 17 percent of GDP in 2023. The trade surplus moderated further in 2024 as hydrocarbon
export continued to decline. On the other hand, tourism and transportation services were buoyant,
and remittance outflows remained stable despite a rise in expatriate employment. The QCB’s
international reserves rose gradually to US$53.8 billion in November 2024, strengthening the reserve
coverage (projected to reach 62 percent of the ARA metric by end 2024). This is complemented by
the sizeable foreign assets held by Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), estimated to have exceeded
200 percent of GDP in 2023, through which a significant share of the hydrocarbon windfalls is
invested abroad. The external position is assessed to be moderately stronger than the level
suggested by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies (Annex II).

The fiscal stance loosened moderately in 2023 (Figure 4). The overall fiscal surplus
narrowed to 5.6 percent of GDP in 2023 and declined further in the first three quarters of 2024 as
hydrocarbon revenues weakened. The 2023 central government spending rose by 3 percentage

points (ppts) of GDP from 2022 (1½ ppts of GDP above budgeted). The 2023 non-hydrocarbon
primary balance (NHPB) thus worsened by 1½ ppts of non-hydrocarbon GDP from 2022,
representing a moderate fiscal loosening. The central government debt remained largely unchanged
in percent of GDP (43 percent at end-2023).
7.
The banking sector remains healthy (Figure 5 and Text Figure 6). Banks are wellcapitalized (with the Capital Adequacy Ratio of close to 20 percent in 2024Q3) and liquid, with
robust net interest margin (NIM) as higher funding costs were mostly passed on to borrowers.
Banks’ non-interest income also increased, supporting profitability. The sector-wide NPL ratio
remained broadly unchanged at 3.9 percent in 2024Q3, but bank-level NPLs varied considerably,
tilted to the weaker side. On the other hand, NPLs are relatively well provisioned, by more than
80 percent. Actions have also been taken to address relatively high NPLs in some banks,
including through restructuring. Since the implementation of QCB measures to reduce banks’
net exposure to short-term foreign liabilities, 1 banks’ non-resident deposits declined
significantly in 2022 before stabilizing (as a share of total liabilities) since 2023, and other
foreign liabilities fell only modestly. Banks’ foreign liabilities thus remained elevated, but with
lengthened average maturity and more diversified external funding sources.

1 percent in 2024, before converging to
2 percent over the medium term as monetary policy eases and growth strengthens.
9.
The external and fiscal surpluses will likely remain, albeit declining as a share of GDP.
Qatar’s LNG production expansion is set to generate significant hydrocarbon revenues and maintain
the twin surpluses, assuming continued fiscal discipline. The surpluses (in percent of GDP), however,
are projected to moderate over the medium term as hydrocarbon prices are expected to soften.
Central government debt is set to gradually decline to around 36 percent of GDP by 2029. Qatar is
assessed to have a low overall risk of sovereign stress (Annex IV).
10.
Risks to the outlook are broadly balanced (Annex V). Main external downside risks include
a sharper-than-expected global growth slowdown, increased volatility in global financial conditions
and commodity prices, and further worsening of geopolitical tensions. The regional conflict has had
limited impact on Qatar, but adds further to the downside risks with potential impact through lower
tourism and capital inflows, and more volatile hydrocarbon prices. Domestic downside risk stems
mainly from further weaknesses in the real estate sector, while the risk could be mitigated by the
proper implementation of the measures introduced in 2023 to enhance transparency and regulation
of real estate activities 2 as well as strong tourism. Over the medium and long term, the expected
significant expansion of global natural gas supply could exert downward price pressures, although
Qatar’s low production cost and proven reliability could mitigate the impact (Text Figure 8). 3 Other
key downside risks include worsening climate stressors and a disorderly global energy transition. On

In 2023, the law regulating the real estate sector was updated, the Real Estate Regulatory Authority was established

the upside, sustained high hydrocarbon prices and accelerated NDS3 reforms would strengthen the
outlook. However, if ambitious NDS3 initiatives lead to resource misallocation, both the public
finance and growth prospect would be affected.

Authorities’ Views
11.
The authorities broadly concurred with staff’s assessment of the economic outlook
and risks. They highlighted the significant boost to growth from the NF LNG expansion and
intensifying reform efforts to meet ambitious NDS3 targets. They noted that the regional conflict
had no visible impact on Qatar, including on LNG shipment. The authorities highlighted that strong
tourism and reforms related to permanent residency through real estate investments would provide
further boost to the real estate sector, and the policy measures to regulate real estate activities
introduced last year would help mitigate potential risks. Overall, the authorities reiterated that
Qatar’s strong fundamentals and policy buffers would help dampen any negative impact if downside
risks materialize.

POLICIES TO PURSUE TRANSFORMATION AMID
GLOBAL HEADWINDS

Policy discussions focused on maintaining stability against the global headwinds and
accelerating reforms. Building on the progress in implementing past recommendations (Annex VI),
policy discussions focused on: (i) sustaining fiscal discipline and accelerating revenue, expenditure
and fiscal institutional reforms; (ii) safeguarding financial sector stability and deepening financial
markets; (iii) further enhancing the effectiveness of the monetary policy operational framework; and
(iv) intensifying structural reforms guided by NDS3.

Figure 9). 4 The 2024 budget envisages
spending cuts worth 2 ppts of GDP from
the 2023 outturn, mostly in capital
expenditure, while the fiscal outturn up to
the third quarter of 2024 suggests that the
overall expenditure cuts could be milder
than budgeted, closer to 1½ ppts pf GDP.
Nonetheless, the fiscal stance is still likely
to tighten, with the NHPB projected to
improve by around ¾ ppt of nonhydrocarbon GDP. The 2025 budget
envisages broadly prudent spending plans
amid the growth rebound. The mediumterm budget has been updated to reflect
NDS3 spending needs, where continued
gradual consolidation is expected.

Staff welcomed the authorities’
commitment to continued fiscal
prudence and recommended adopting a
fiscal anchor to support the strategy.
The PIH-based benchmark can serve as a
medium-term fiscal anchor to ensure intergenerational equity. Higher-than-expected hydrocarbon
revenues should be saved to strengthen fiscal buffers. During economic downturns, some fiscal
space could be deployed to provide targeted support, while a credible plan should be in place to
guide the NHPB to return to the PIH-based fiscal anchor (with a view to eventually introducing a
fiscal rule). 5 The assessment of fiscal stance would be more accurate if expenditures by government
related entities (GREs) are also accounted for. The PIH-based fiscal anchor should be updated
periodically as the global energy transition unfolds to ensure realistic long-term oil price
assumptions.
15.
Revenue diversification should accelerate to enhance resilience and modernize the tax
system. The highly uncertain global energy transition is now compounded by rising geopolitical

tensions, potentially exacerbating Qatar’s
hydrocarbon revenue volatility (from both prices
and export volume). To strengthen resilience and
reduce Qatar’s potential tax revenue gap, nonhydrocarbon revenue diversification should
accelerate, taking advantage of Qatar’s favorable
medium-term outlook (Text Figure 10). 6 Priorities
include to:
• Introduce the value-added tax (VAT). The
tax authority has readied the infrastructure
for VAT introduction and staff reiterated that
the authorities accelerate the introduction of
a broad-based VAT with a starting rate in line
with the GCC treaty. The VAT implementation
would not only bring in additional revenue
(up to 1½ percent of GDP with a VAT rate of
5 percent), but also help gather
comprehensive information, facilitating other
tax introduction and administration. The
initial growth and inflation impact of VAT
introduction is estimated to be transitory and
small. 7 The negative growth impact could be
further mitigated by using the VAT revenue
productively. Allowing businesses sufficient
time to prepare (e.g., 12 months) is also
crucial for a smooth rollout.
Broaden the corporate income tax (CIT).
Along with other GCC countries, Qatar is
committed to adopt the global minimum CIT
on multinationals (foreign companies are
already subject to 10 percent of CIT in Qatar).
It is encouraging that Qatar is aiming to start
the implementation from the beginning of
2025, consistent with the global timetable.
The implementation should proceed in line
with global trends to avoid revenue losses
and minimize the compliance burden on
businesses. Introducing a CIT for domestic
firms (with appropriate thresholds) could also

be considered over the medium term to further broaden the tax base and allow a level playing
field between domestic and foreign firms.
16.
Gradually aligning Qatar’s domestic energy prices with its corresponding export prices
could increase revenue, generate savings, and support Qatar’s climate goals. Thanks to
previous subsidy reforms, domestic energy price differentials from international ones are lower in
Qatar than in its regional and emerging market (EM) peers (Text Figure 11). To further reduce the
price differentials, the caps on diesel and gasoline prices should be lifted and remaining electricity
subsidies gradually phased out. The natural gas price differential (IEA, 2022) partially reflects the
supply-demand dynamics in domestic and international markets. 8 The first step is to improve
transparency of domestic gas pricing to better understand its disparity with Qatar’s export prices.
Liquefication and export facilities could be expanded alongside the North Field LNG expansion to
allow export of extra domestic gas supply to generate additional revenue and support Qatar’s
climate initiatives to ensure efficient natural gas use domestically. Gradually aligning domestic
natural gas prices with export ones would also incentivize the private sector to build comparative
advantages beyond low energy cost, fostering diversification that is not reliant on the hydrocarbon
sector.

Spending efficiency and composition should continue to improve to strengthen fiscal
sustainability and support NDS3 reforms, including to:

Reorient public spending toward higher returns. Qatar’s fiscal multipliers over the last three
decades are estimated to be stronger than those in other GCC countries, especially for capital
expenditure. However, multipliers have fallen as the investment cycle from the World Cup
matured, suggesting more limited returns from future public infrastructure investment (Box I).
Meanwhile, investment to build a knowledge-based economy, including to leverage Qatar’s
advanced digital access and readiness to embrace artificial intelligence (AI) (see Section D), and
enhance climate resilience and sustainability, could generate high returns, not only in terms of
direct growth gains, but also in creating an enabling environment for the private sector. 9 Any
public sector-driven initiatives to promote private sector development should avoid supporting
unviable firms. Meanwhile, as Qatar undertakes necessary fiscal reforms, such as introducing the
VAT and gradually phasing out subsidies, targeted transfers to vulnerable households are
important to strengthen social protection.

•

Strengthen public investment management. IMF estimates suggest that the most efficient
public investors can achieve twice the growth impact from their investment than the least
efficient ones. 10 Staff’s past analysis suggests room to further improve Qatar’s public investment
efficiency. As new investment will be undertaken to support NDS3, the authorities could benefit
from the IMF’s Public Investment Management Assessment (PIMA) and/or Climate-PIMA.
Box 1. Estimating Fiscal Multipliers in Qatar and the GCC
This box estimates fiscal multipliers in Qatar and its GCC peers over the past three decades.1 This
analysis examines fiscal multipliers, defined as the non-hydrocarbon growth gains from government
spending, from different expenditures over time, with a special attention to the level of capital stock to
capture the potential negative impact of excessive use of seemingly productive expenditures (Devarajan et
al., 1996). Our empirical strategy broadly follows Espinoza et al. (2011) and Fouejieu et al (2018) with both a
GCC panel estimate (and teasing out Qatar-specific effects) and a single-country time-series analysis for
Qatar.
Generally, Qatar had stronger fiscal multipliers than its GCC peers, but the gains from capital
expenditure weakened when capital stock became relatively high. Results from cross-GCC panel
regression suggest that for the GCC, the average long-run fiscal multiplier for capital expenditure (0.7) is
stronger and more persistent than that for current expenditure (statistically insignificant), although the
growth gains from the former emerge with a lag. The Qatar-specific long-term cumulative multiplier for
capital expenditure (based on the GCC panel regression and a country dummy for Qatar) is close to 1.5.
When capital stock is relatively high, however, the capital spending multipliers for both Qatar and the GCC
become insignificant.
A further analysis confirms how growth gains from capital spending in Qatar waned when the
infrastructure investment cycle appeared to have matured (Box Figure 1-1). Using a single-county
approach, time-varying fiscal multipliers from capital spending in Qatar are estimated on a 12-year rolling
basis. Results suggest that World Cup-related capital spending in the 2010s had stronger (first panel) and
more persistent (second panel) growth impact than previous public investment. These may reflect a more
comprehensive infrastructure investment strategy and/or higher spending efficiency.2 However, as the
infrastructure investment cycle started to mature, the growth effects moderated.

Welcome efforts to strengthen fiscal institutions pave the way to adopt a full-fledged
medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF) with enhanced fiscal risk management:
•

MTFF with strengthened budget execution and risk assessment. The extension of the
medium-term budget to five years and progress in introducing program-based budgeting are
encouraging. Staff also welcomed the authorities’ initiative to enhance macroeconomic
projections to support the medium-term budget update. These efforts pave the way to
introduce a full-fledged MTFF, anchored by the PIH benchmark, to strengthen fiscal
sustainability and ensure priority spending. The MTFF should guide and be integrated into the
annual budget process, with performance-based allocations and strengthened budget execution
to ensure compliance. The MTFF and annual budget should be complemented by regular fiscal
risk assessments, including those stemming from Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs, see below),
and underpinned by enhanced fiscal transparency. IMF technical assistance (TA) on the MTFF
can support the authorities’ efforts.

•

Managing fiscal risks from PPPs. Around QAR10 billion (US$2¾ billion) of PPP projects are in the
pipeline, focusing on health, education, hospitality, and infrastructure. It is critical to manage
potential fiscal risks (including contingent liabilities) by adopting an appropriate risk-sharing and
monitoring framework, underpinned by transparency and strong governance. PPPs should be fully
integrated into the state budget and the MTFF.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Establishing a sovereign asset-liability management framework encompassing the general
government, including the QIA and GREs, would help coordinate investments for economic
transformation and enhance asset-liability management.

Authorities’ Views
19.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to fiscal discipline and broadly shared
staff’s views on the fiscal strategy. They highlighted that funding allocations for NDS3 initiatives
were prudent with an emphasis on public spending efficiency. To this end, the authorities noted
good progress in expanding program-based budgeting to eventually cover all sectors by 2025, and
expected that the ongoing expenditure review would generate savings in the medium term. The
authorities also expressed initial interest in exploring a PIH-based fiscal anchor. They saw fiscal risks
from ongoing PPPs, mainly on operating and maintaining existing infrastructure, to be small. The
authorities stressed that no subsidies on natural gas were provided, but expressed willingness in
exploring ways to increase the transparency of domestic natural gas price setting. They emphasized
that access to reliable energy sources would play a critical role in attracting FDI and promoting
economic diversification more broadly. The authorities agreed on the need to diversify revenues and
committed to implement the CIT Pillar II in line with the global timetable (the Cabinet recently
approved a draft law amending some provisions of the Income Tax Law and referred it to the Shura
Council). They continued to assess the appropriate timing for VAT introduction. Under the overall
objective of gradually reducing government debt, the authorities’ debt management strategy takes
into account the need for green financing and for supporting domestic financial market deepening,
in coordination with the QCB.

B. Financial Sector Policy: Maintain Stability and Deepen Markets
20.
Vigilant QCB policies have helped secure financial stability, while pockets of
vulnerabilities warrant continued diligence (Figure 5). The banking sector remains healthy despite
the growth normalization and tighter financial conditions, thanks to robust buffers, diligent QCB
policies and ample hydrocarbon liquidity. Recent QCB measures to reduce banks’ short-term foreign
asset-liability mismatches and risks in their exposure to a weaker real estate market are welcome,
especially as easing global financial conditions could stimulate foreign funding by banks and real
estate companies. The QCB should make more granular data (e.g., the average maturity structure of
banking sector foreign assets and liabilities, NPLs by sector) available to enhance monitoring and
facilitate risk assessment. The NPL ratio will likely remain contained as economic activity picks up
and credit demand strengthens. In this context, continued diligence in supervision is important
especially for banks with weaker asset qualities. Qatar Development Bank (QDB) initiatives to
support SMEs should be limited to viable but liquidity-constrained firms. Further increase in the
already high sovereign-bank nexus calls for attention. Some banks have partly replaced their foreign
funding with public sector deposits, but access to such deposits is reportedly uneven, with smaller
banks facing higher funding costs (Text Figure 13). The availability of public sector deposits could
also be affected by hydrocarbon revenue volatility. To this end, the ongoing initiatives to deepen the
domestic capital market would help banks diversify their funding sources. On the asset side, sizeable

16

bank holdings of public sector assets in gross terms (around 30 percent of total assets 11) could
crowd out credit to the private sector, slowing the transition to private sector-led growth.
21.
The QCB should continue to enhance banking sector resilience and formalize the
financial safety net. Welcome QCB initiatives to improve risk-based supervision, establish a deposit
insurance scheme and formalize the recovery and resolution frameworks are supported by IMF TAs.
The authorities (including the QCB, MOF and QIA) have traditionally lent strong support to banks
during market turbulences and formalizing crisis management frameworks would further enhance
predictability, efficiency and confidence. The QCB should continue to review its macroprudential
policies and adjust as needed to mitigate potential macro-financial risks, which tend to build up
amid easing financial conditions. Building on the QCB's progress in strengthening financial stability,
staff continued to recommend that Qatar undertake an FSAP update (last FSAP was concluded in
2007).

The Third Financial Sector Strategy (FSS3) puts a welcome emphasis on domestic
financial markets deepening—timely and well-coordinated implementation is essential. The
Strategy, launched in November 2023, seeks to promote savings, offer borrowing and investment
opportunities, develop the insurance sector, foster fintech, and achieve greater financial inclusion.
Many initiatives have been introduced, including to lend greater support to SMEs, accelerate digital
transformation, and expand financial service offering including advisory. Regulatory sandboxes have
been expanded to accelerate fintech innovation and the Qatar Financial Center’s digital asset
framework has established the legal and regulatory foundation for digital assets. The QCB is also
exploring the concept of a wholesale CBDC and has requested IMF TA. Work is ongoing to promote
greater awareness and penetration of insurance products to enhance resilience to shocks. Setting up

of primary dealers and a derivatives exchange will facilitate capital market deepening. Initiatives to
foster more stable domestic funding would complement the QCB measures in reducing banks’
reliance on short-term foreign funding. To help intensify reform implementation in adherence to
FSS3, the QCB launched own Strategy 2024–30 in October 2024. Key stakeholders, including
different regulatory authorities, should coordinate to ensure policy consistency and timely
implementation.
23.
Qatar has made excellent progress in fighting financial crimes, and strong efforts
should continue. The 2023 AML/CFT mutual evaluation report by FATF acknowledges Qatar’s
strength in preventing financial crimes and law enforcement through improved risk assessment
capacity and clearer policy priorities. Measures to reduce risks associated with the use of a large
amount of cash are complemented by efforts to enhance financial inclusion through digitalization.
The QCB has banned financial institutions to use crypto assets. A beneficial ownership registry is
being operationalized. Going forward, Qatar should strengthen risk-based supervision of nonfinancial businesses and professions, ensure that the beneficial ownership information is accurate
and easily accessible, and improve further the capacity of AML/CFT law enforcement agencies.
Authorities’ Views
24.
The authorities concurred with staff’s recommendation to continue exercising
vigilance. The QCB highlighted that the newly introduced risk-based supervision strengthened
assessment of emerging risks and early action. They believed that banks were well prepared to
manage legacy real estate sector weaknesses and the recent macroprudential measures were
effectively implemented to address potential risks. The QCB also highlighted banks’ progress in
lengthening the average maturity of foreign liabilities including via issuance of medium-term notes,
and its commitment to regular risk reassessment. More broadly, the QCB stressed that both the
micro and macroprudential measures, including the counter-cyclical capital buffer, were periodically
reviewed and would be dynamically adjusted to manage emerging risks. The authorities supported
staff’s call for deepening domestic capital markets, highlighting ongoing efforts in this area as part
of the FSS3 implementation, including an initiative with the Ministry of Finance to build the domestic
yield curve.

C. Monetary Policy: Further Enhance Effectiveness of the Operational

Framework

25.
The exchange rate peg continues to serve Qatar well. The peg remains a credible
monetary anchor, backed by ample external buffers, continued fiscal prudence and competitivenessenhancing reforms. In line with the exchange rate peg, Qatar’s monetary policy is broadly aligned
with that of the U.S. Federal Reserve. More recently, the QCB cut policy interest rates three times,
each time 5 basis points more than the US Federal Reserve did, narrowing the interest rate
differential with the US fed funds rate (Figure 2). Going forward, staff recommended that the QCB
continue to adjust its policy rates in line with the US Federal Reserve. The QCB’s enhanced liquidity
management is welcome and could benefit from stronger coordination with the fiscal authority.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

QATAR

26.
Several key actions would further strengthen the effectiveness of the monetary policy
operational framework (Text Figure 14). As recommended by a recent IMF TA, the QCB should
improve analytical capacity for liquidity forecasting and country risk premium assessment as the first
step towards more effective liquidity management and monetary policy implementation. Finalizing
the upgrade to a new real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system towards a more integrated
wholesale payment system will reduce risks and enhance efficiency in the central bank’s secured
lending operations. Over time, establishing a wider and more stable policy interest rate corridor,
developing a more active interbank market, and allowing banks to base their lending rates fully on
market conditions by removing the cap on salary-based personal loans would further enhance
monetary policy transmission. Greater central bank communication would also be important to
support these efforts.

27.
The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment on the exchange rate regime and
appreciated IMF TA on liquidity management. They emphasized the ongoing effort to build
capacity and planned to progressively implement TA recommendations. The QCB noted that the
recent policy interest rate cuts, slightly more than the US Federal Reserve’s, were motivated by a
relatively wide interest rate differential to the Fed funds rate, domestic macroeconomic conditions
(growth normalization and low inflation), and excess liquidity in the financial system. They
highlighted that the recent policy moves did not have any negative effects including on capital
flows, and future policy decisions would be data driven. The QCB acknowledged the need to further
improve the effectiveness of monetary policy operational framework but saw it as a medium-term
objective. They agreed on the importance of communication and highlighted continued efforts to
enhance it.

D. Structural Reforms: Build a Knowledge-Based and Sustainable Economy
28.
Qatar’s vision to build a diversified, knowledge-based economy requires enhanced
human capital and output complexity (Text Figures 15 and 16). Staff analysis shows that human
capital is not only a large, direct contributor to per-capita output, but also an amplifier of the
growth-enhancing impact of higher economic complexity. 12 Physical capital has similar, albeit
smaller, effects. When a country has high levels of human and physical capital, the amplification

Qatar can build a future-ready labor force by:

•

Attracting and retaining high-skilled expatriate workers. Qatar currently has more semiskilled expatriate workers than skilled or highly skilled ones (Text Figure 17). Analysis in the IMF’s
2023 Article IV Staff Report for Qatar suggests that increasing the share of more skilled
expatriate workers can be a top contributor to growth. Intensified Kafala reform would further
enhance expatriate labor market protection and flexibility. Speedy implementation of newly
introduced programs targeting higher-skilled expatriate labor (e.g., new visa schemes including
a five-year Mustaqel residence visa for foreign talent and entrepreneurs and a visa extension
program for graduating students to find jobs in Qatar) would improve labor force skills.
Strengthening the social safety net including the pension scheme would also help. The renewed
4-year collaboration program with ILO can support the authorities’ progress.

•

Enhancing the nationals’ talent and employment in the private sector. Qatar’s education
investment is bearing fruit—more outcome-based education spending could help close the gap
with OECD countries (Text Figure 17). Efforts should also strengthen to incentivize Qatari
nationals to join the private sector, especially the new graduates. A recently launched AI-based
platform to match Qatari graduates with private sector jobs is a welcome initiative. To achieve
the NDS3 target of having 20 percent of Qataris employed in the private sector, effective
coordination across public and private sectors, education institutions, and youth associations is
essential to align education with the private sector needs and ensure proper active labor market
policies (e.g., reskilling and upskilling programs) to facilitate the nationals’ employment in the
private sector. As sectoral Qatarization targets are being set and government incentives for
private sector employers to hire Qatari nationals are being contemplated, potential benefits,
including savings on the public sector wage bill, should be balanced against risks, including skill
mismatches. It would be helpful to leverage the ILO’s expertise in setting sectoral Qatarization
targets and active labor market policies.

Further benefiting from the female talent. Qatari women’s overall access to schooling is on
par with, or exceeds (e.g., in higher education), that of men, but a sizeable gender gap remains
in labor force participation rates (IMF’s 2023 Article IV Staff Report for Qatar). Ensuring gender
equality is a key goal in Qatar’s National Vision 2030, and many initiatives have been introduced
to empower women and close gender gaps, including in education and the labor market. Recent
efforts include to allow flexible and remote work arrangements, and to lengthen paid maternity
leaves in government agencies. Continued efforts to increase female labor force participation,
especially in the private sector, would enhance overall labor force skills and Qatar’s productivity.
Encouraging female students to focus on subjects with more private sector demand, providing
special entrepreneurship programs, and increasing female representation in decision making
bodies would also allow Qatar to benefit more from this talent pool. 13

Boosting Qatar’s economic complexity calls for (Text Figures 18 and 19):
Fostering innovation. Qatar’s patent applications rose rapidly over the last decade, more so
than in its GCC peers. To promote innovation and support start-ups, a venture capital program
(“Fund of Funds”) is being established by the QIA. NDS3 aims to increase Qatar’s R&D funding
from the current 0.7 percent of GDP to 1.5 percent, with the majority from the private sector.
More attention is needed to enhance Qatar’s R&D spending efficiency and quality. Further
improvement in intellectual property rights protection (e.g., in patent and trademark protection)
is also key.

Promoting trade diversification. Progress in Qatar’s export diversification is limited, mainly in
services export (transportation and tourism). For a country with a small domestic market, export
diversification, especially in higher value-added goods and services, is particularly important. To
this end, Qatar should further reduce non-tariff barriers, facilitate intra-GCC trade, upgrade trade
infrastructure, liberalize services trade, promote free trade agreements and leverage new trade
corridors (Middle Corridor from China to Europe; India-Middle East-Europe Corridor).

Attracting FDI and boosting domestic knowledge spillovers. FDI inflows to Qatar have
traditionally focused on the hydrocarbon sector, but more recently inflows to knowledge sectors
(e.g., ICT) rose. Further reducing entry barriers for foreign firms and promoting healthy
competition are crucial to attract FDI. Qatar’s increasing focus on PPPs and further intra-GCC
financial integration could also help boost FDI. Enhanced human capital and innovation,
including to strengthen SMEs’ access to technology via financing, could facilitate domestic
knowledge spillovers from FDI.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Further improving business efficiency. Qatar performs well in competitiveness indicators,
including on the overall business efficiency. Looking ahead, Qatar could further ease access to
finance, especially for SMEs which represent a large share of domestic firms. Reforms to protect
legal rights of borrowers and lenders, simplify insolvency procedures to accelerate resolution
and improve recovery rate, strengthen creditor assessment tools, and proper use of fintech
would ease SMEs’ financing constraints. Continued efforts to streamline business regulations
and procedures, improve transparency and accountability, and further deepen public sector
digitalization would support the transition to private sector-led growth. As Qatar considers
privatization of certain state assets to enhance efficiency and foster private sector participation,
it is crucial to ensure strong governance and transparency, preserve the state’s best interest, and
use the privatization proceeds productively.

Successful implementation of Qatar’s ambitious reform agenda hinges on proper
prioritization, inter-agency coordination, effective execution, and careful management of
policy spillovers. Many reform initiatives are in train to achieve NDS3 goals. They should be
properly sequenced to prioritize more impactful reforms and explore synergies and
complementarities. Inter-agency coordination is critical to ensure policy consistency and maximize
implementation capacity. Incentives to various specialized economic zones and centers to promote
FDI and trade, as well as policy support to “diversification clusters,” should target well-identified
externalities, market and coordination failures, or under-provision of public input—they are no
substitution for broad-based structural reforms. Diversification gains from economic zones and
priority sectors should be broadened to the wider economy by promoting stronger spillovers.
Periodic cost-benefit assessments will help rationalize incentives and keep them time-bound.
32.

Enhancing digital skills of the labor force,
promoting digital/AI penetration in production, strengthening cybersecurity risk management and
facilitating job transitions are critical to fully benefit from digitalization and AI while mitigating labor
market risks.
33.
Qatar has advanced its climate agenda further. In early-2024, Qatar raised $2.5 billion in a
debut green deal under its new sovereign green financing framework. In June 2024, the QCB
launched the ESG and Sustainability Strategy for the financial sector to strengthen the financial
system’s capacity in supporting national sustainability goals. The share of energy capacity from
renewables reached about 9 percent in 2023 against a target of 20 percent by 2030 (Text Figure 21).
The NDS3’s emphasis on improving energy and water use efficiency is welcome. A concerted effort
is needed to achieve Qatar’s climate goals, including to gradually phase out remaining energy
subsidies and reduce domestic energy price differentials from export prices, increase green
investment, promote climate financing, enhance interagency coordination, and upgrade the
regulatory framework. 14

Box 2. AI in Qatar: Opportunities and Potential Economic Impact1
Qatar has been actively preparing for embracing AI. In 2019, Qatar released its first National AI Strategy,
focusing on education, data access, employment, business, research, and ethics. The AI Committee,
established in 2021, coordinates efforts from ministries, universities, and financial institutions. A $2.5 billion
AI investment package was announced in May 2024. AI-related research has also surged. Overall, Qatar is
close to AEs in its AI readiness (text chart).
Increasing AI adoption in Qatar is expected to bring more benefits than risks to the labor market.
Currently, about 37 percent of the labor force in Qatar is exposed to AI (18 ppts increase over a decade),
comparable to the EM average but lower than the AE average (58 percent). Building on IMF (2023)2 staff
analysis suggests that about 75 percent of the high AI exposure jobs in Qatar have high
“complementarity”—workers in those jobs are more likely to benefit from AI-driven productivity gains than
being replaced. Qatar’s labor market opportunity-to-risk ratio from AI exposure is significantly higher than
EM or AE averages.

Box 2. AI in Qatar: Opportunities and Potential Economic Impact (concluded)
The private sector has played an important role in shifting Qatar’s labor market toward a more
favorable position for AI adoption. Private sector employment has grown by around 27 percent over the
last decade, but the number of technicians and professionals—two job categories with high AI exposure and
complementarity—has increased by over 90 percent, significantly enhancing the country's potential to
benefit from AI adoption.
“Enabling clusters” identified in NDS3 are likely to harness AI-driven productivity gains. By matching
the occupational composition of these clusters (IT & digital, financial services, and education) in Qatar with
the AI exposure-complementarity matrix, staff finds that these sectors concentrate in the high AI exposure
and complementarity quadrant. On the other hand, the “growth clusters” identified in NDS3—
manufacturing, logistics, and tourism—tend to have more limited AI exposure.
Scenario analysis points to potential gains in labor productivity from AI penetration in Qatar. Staff
analysis suggests that, under an optimistic scenario where successful reforms to enhance human capital,
innovation and private sector growth allow a more rapid increase in the share of jobs exposed to AI and
faster AI adoption (than under the baseline), labor productivity growth could be lifted by an average of 1 ppt
annually (above the baseline) over the medium term.

Authorities’ Views
34.
The authorities concurred with staff’s call to accelerate structural reforms, and noted
that a large number of initiatives and projects were underway guided by NDS3. The newly
established National Planning Council highlighted its role in prioritizing reforms, ensuring interagency coordination and monitoring progress. The authorities agreed with staff recommendation to
focus reforms on boosting human capital and innovation, enhancing the business environment,
attracting FDI and promoting exports. They agreed that Qatar was well placed to leverage AI for
productivity gains, and highlighted Qatar’s comparative advantage in energy cost and reliability to
attract data centers, around which an ecosystem could be built to enhance domestic value added.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

27

QATAR

The authorities stressed that they were on track to meet the 2030 climate targets guided by the
National Environment and Climate Change Strategy and National Climate Change Action Plan.

E. Enhancing Data Adequacy
35.
Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, but gaps remain (Annex VII). The
authorities are fully committed to meeting the IMF standards under the Enhanced General Data
Dissemination System (e-GDDS). Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, but gaps
remain in the coverage and granularity of fiscal and external statistics, especially for the International
Investment Position (including QIA positions), FDI and portfolio investment. The strong emphasis on
data in NDS3 is encouraging, and the NPC is working to enhance inter-agency coordination for data
collection and dissemination. The IMF stands ready to support the authorities’ progress in data and
statistics through capacity building.
Authorities’ Views
36.
The authorities welcomed the IMF’s initiative to strengthen data adequacy and agreed
with staff assessment. They noted that the establishment of the national statistics center under the
NPC would enhance data collection and dissemination and expressed interest in collaborating with
the IMF, including through TA. The gaps in external sector statistics were well recognized, and the
NPC stressed that strong efforts were underway to enhance FDI data, which is also important for
monitoring and assessing progress in NDS3 initiatives.

STAFF APPRAISAL
37.
Qatar has a favorable economic outlook and continues to demonstrate resilience to
external shocks. Recent indicators suggest that the post-World Cup growth normalization has
bottomed out and the gradual rebound in economic activities is gaining momentum. The mediumterm outlook is more positive, driven by significant increases in LNG production and the anticipated
benefits from NDS3 implementation. By maintaining prudent macroeconomic policies and
accelerating reform efforts, Qatar can further solidify its resilience to shocks and prosperity.
38.
The authorities’ commitment to sustain fiscal discipline can be supported by
accelerated fiscal reforms. Adopting a PIH-based medium-term fiscal anchor can help ensure
intergenerational equity and guide a countercyclical fiscal policy. Accelerating revenue
diversification including to introduce the VAT would enhance revenue resilience and reduce the tax
revenue gap. To support efficient NDS3 reform implementation and ensure fiscal sustainability, it is
important to enhance spending efficiency through rationalizing the wage bill and gradually phasing
out the remaining subsidies, and improve spending composition to facilitate the transition to private
sector-led growth. Gradually aligning domestic energy prices with export ones could generate
additional revenue and support Qatar’s climate goals. The ongoing efforts to strengthen fiscal
institutions pave the way to adopt a full-fledged MTFF with enhanced fiscal risk management.

28

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

QATAR

39.
Strong efforts to maintain financial stability and deepen domestic financial market
should continue. Maintaining diligent supervision is important especially for banks with weaker
asset qualities. Formalizing the financial safety net would further enhance financial stability. The QCB
should continue to review its macroprudential policies and adjust as needed to mitigate potential
macro-financial risks. Guided by FSS3, efforts to develop domestic capital market should accelerate,
which would also help banks reduce their reliance on public sector deposits and exposure to shortterm foreign funding. Qatar’s excellent efforts in fighting financial crimes should continue.
40.
The exchange rate peg continues to serve Qatar well. The QCB should continue to adjust
its policy rates in line with the US Federal Reserve while improving its liquidity forecasting. Over
time, establishing a wider and more stable policy interest rate corridor, promoting a more active
interbank market, and allowing fully market-based bank lending interest rates would enhance
monetary policy transmission. Qatar’s external position in 2023 was assessed to be moderately
stronger than the level implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies.
41.
Qatar’s vision to build a more diversified and knowledge-based economy calls for
enhancing human capital and boosting economic complexity. Attracting and retaining highskilled expatriate workers, enhancing the nationals’ talent and employment in the private sector, and
further benefiting from the female talent will enhance human capital. Economic complexity can be
boosted by fostering innovation, promoting trade diversification, attracting FDI with domestic
knowledge spillovers, and further improving business efficiency. Successful implementation of
Qatar’s ambitious reform agenda hinges on proper prioritization, inter-agency coordination,
effective execution, and careful management of policy spillovers. Efforts to leverage digitalization
and AI will bring productivity gains, and climate actions should continue. Data provision is broadly
adequate for surveillance and the authorities are encouraged to close the remaining gaps.
42.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Qatar take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Annex I. Overview of Qatar’s Third National Development Strategy
This Annex provides a brief overview of the Third National Development Strategy (NDS3), which sets
the priorities to build a knowledge-based and more sustainable economy. It stresses the state’s role as
an enabler of private sector-led growth, based on a candid assessment of the limitations and
challenges associated with a state-driven growth model.
1.
Qatar’s Third National Development Strategy (NDS3) aims for a transformation
toward a private sector-led, knowledge-based, and more sustainable economy (Annex Figure
1-1). Issued in January 2024, NDS3 covers the last miles of Qatar’s National Vision (QNV) 2030. From
NDS1 (2011-16), NDS2 (2018-22) to NDS3 (2024-30), Qatar’s diversification strategy has gradually
transitioned from a public sector-driven, infrastructure-focused approach, to one that empowers the
private sector to build a more dynamic and innovative economy (Table 1). NDS3 aims to leverage
Qatar’s strengths built over the last decade, including large financial resources, enhanced human
capital, and high-quality infrastructure. The strategy lays out a systematic approach for economic
transformation, with ambitious targets set.
2.
NDS3 highlights Qatar’s progress made since the launch of the Qatar National Vision
2030. Substantial strides have been made in economic, human, social, environmental, and
institutional development. In particular, Qatar has achieved solid economic growth during 2008–23
(average 5½ percent), with the share of non-hydrocarbon economy rising by more than 10
percentage points (ppts) to 63 ppts. Qatar’s education and health systems, labor market including
for expatriate workers, and government effectiveness have also witnessed significant improvements.
3.
NDS3 also recognizes candidly the limitations and key challenges in Qatar’s
diversification journey. Qatar’s progress in economic diversification lags some other GCC
countries, especially in fiscal revenue and exports. NDS3 acknowledges relatively low nonhydrocarbon output growth in recent years with declining labor productivity, its costly diversification
model driven largely by public sector spending with implications for fiscal sustainability, and
incentives that hinder private sector development, entrepreneurship, and innovation. Skilled and
highly skilled employment rose (including both nationals and expatriates) but the majority remains
less skilled. NDS3 points out barriers to market entry and FDI, various regulatory impediments, an
immature innovation ecosystem, and insufficient human capital as key challenges for further
transformation. The global energy transition only compounds the need to accelerate economic
diversification.
4.
NDS3 stresses that the state should become an “enabler” of more vibrant and
sustainable private sector-driven growth. A wide range of reforms are envisaged to close
remaining gaps in innovation, human capital, and the regulatory environment. NDS3 highlights the
need to harmonize economic zones to help attract FDI, boost international trade including through
additional trade agreements with key target markets, and Public-Private partnership (PPP) to
facilitate private sector participation. It also identifies “diversification clusters” to build comparative
advantages, setting ambitious targets both at the sectoral level and on macroeconomic outcomes.

5. In particular, NDS3 lays out seven strategic outcomes with numerical targets:
•

Growth model. A more sustainable growth model is envisaged, underpinned by Qatar’s
stronger position in the global gas market and a focus on high productivity “diversification
clusters” –– growth clusters (manufacturing, logistics and tourism), enabling clusters (IT & digital,
financial and education) and resilience clusters (food and agriculture, health). Key
macroeconomic targets include to achieve an average annual real GDP growth, both for total
and non-hydrocarbon, of 4 percent (the past five-year-average was at 0.8 and 1.5 percent,
respectively), create a top-10 global business environment, attract $100 billion FDI inflows
(cumulatively over 2024–30), increase R&D spending to 1.5 percent of GDP (currently at
0.7 percent of GDP) with 60 percent from the private sector, and improve labor productivity
growth to 2 percent annually (the past five-year-average was close to zero).
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

QATAR

•

Fiscal policy. A more sustainable, shock-resistant medium-term fiscal framework is envisaged,
supported by diversified revenues, efficient expenditures, and relatively low debt. Key 2030
targets include to reach a fiscal surplus of 5½ percent of GDP (the past five-year-average was
3 percent), maintain the current sovereign credit ratings of AA/Aa2 with stable outlook, and
achieve manageable expenditure growth (below the non-hydrocarbon output growth rate). The
government plans to reduce procyclicality of spending, implement program-based budgeting,
and enhance debt management through frameworks including sovereign green financing.

•

Human capital. The government will promote STEM education and upskill the Qataris.
Initiatives to attract high-skilled expatriate workers will include labor immigration reforms,
upskilling programs with private sector participation, and new visa schemes for elite talent and
entrepreneurs. The goal is for skilled labor force to exceed 46 percent of the total by 2030
(currently at 28 percent), with 20 percent of the Qatari workforce in the private sector (currently
at 17 percent).

•

Inclusiveness. Qatar aims at maintaining a high fertility rate (of 3 percent) and increase the
economic participation of people with disabilities (to 30 percent by 2030). The government will
launch marriage and family support programs, enhance maternity leave, and promote financial
literacy. For vulnerable segments, initiatives include better identification, skill development, and
expanded social services. Women's empowerment and volunteerism (targeting a 10 percent
volunteer rate) will also be key focuses.

•

Health. Qatar targets a life expectancy of above 82 years and a 36 percent reduction in noncommunicable disease mortality by 2030. Key plans include healthcare infrastructure
optimization, lifestyle programs, and advancing patient care. The government will enhance
urban planning, cultural offerings, and public safety, aiming for fewer than 4.9 traffic deaths per
100,000 population. Satisfaction scores for residents and visitors are targeted to exceed 88
percent.

•

Climate and sustainability. Qatar aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent
relative to the business-as-usual scenario by 2030 and expand renewable energy capacity to
4 GW. The government will protect 30 percent of its land and marine areas, restore 30 percent of
degraded natural habitats and reduce groundwater extraction by 70 percent, with per-capita
water consumption below 310 liters per day. Plans include deploying carbon capture
technologies, expanding biodiversity protection, improving water conservation, and fostering
circular economy practices.

•

Government efficiency. Qatar targets to rank in the top 10 percent on the Government
Effectiveness Index, with 90 percent of services digitalized by 2030. High satisfaction rates are
also set to further reduce corruption and enhance satisfaction of public services. Reforms focus
on strengthening digital capabilities, policy alignment, and performance management. Plans
include launching centralized performance tracking systems, improving data governance, and
enhancing accountability through more efficient and transparent government operations.

Annex II. External Sector Assessment
Overall Assessment: Qatar’s external position moderated in 2023 and was assessed to be moderately
stronger than the level implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. Tourism remained
robust and fiscal prudence was maintained, but hydrocarbon prices normalized and exports declined. In
2024H1, tourism continued to be strong, but hydrocarbon export volume remained weaker than historical
levels, capping the current account surplus. In the medium term, hydrocarbon prices are projected to
progressively decline but export volume is set to increase owing to a significant ramp up in LNG production in
the pipeline. As domestic demand recovers, imports are expected to strengthen. On balance, the current
account gap is expected to continue narrowing.
Potential Policy Responses: Structural reforms to enhance productivity and competitiveness, as envisaged
under NDS3 and the QNV 2030, would help raise private investment and reduce the saving-investment gap.
Fiscal prudence should be preserved, revenue diversification toward non-hydrocarbon sources accelerated, and
spending reoriented to support the reform agenda. These factors will reduce the current gap and help align the
external position in the medium term.

Foreign Assets and Liabilities: Position and Trajectory
Background1. Central bank reserve accumulation was modest as the current account surplus narrowed and
large asset acquisition abroad continued, including by the sovereign wealth fund (QIA). On the liabilities
side, external debt declined somewhat in nominal terms due mainly to repayment of government debt but
rose from 116 percent of GDP in 2022 to 123 percent of GDP in 2023 as nominal GDP shrank more. Central
bank reserves stood at US$53.8 billion in November 2024, up US$2 billion from 2023.
Assessment. On the asset side, QCB’s foreign reserves and sizeable QIA foreign assets together are
estimated to have exceeded 200 percent of GDP in 2023—they will continue to be supported by the
projected current account surpluses over the medium term. On the liabilities side, a moderate level of
external public debt contributes to strong overall fiscal debt sustainability (Annex IV. Fiscal and Debt
Sustainability Assessment). Commercial banks’ external liability remained broadly unchanged, leaving the
net foreign liability relatively large.

Current Account
Background. The current account surplus fell from a decade high in 2022, by nearly 10 percentage points of
GDP to 17 percent of GDP in 2023. Hydrocarbon prices normalized and in late-2023 hydrocarbon export
volume declined amid the regional conflict. Tourism remained strong while both imports and remittance
outflows declined (normalizing after the 2022 FIFA World Cup). In 2024H1, the current account surplus
remained little changed from 2023H1 (US$20 billion). Hydrocarbon exports continued to edge lower and
imports increased as growth started to rebound but tourism remained strong. The current account surplus is
thus expected to abate somewhat to 16½ percent of GDP in 2024 and remain at around 15½ percent of
GDP in the medium-term buoyed by the LNG production expansion in the North Field and relatively high,
albeit gradually falling, hydrocarbon prices.

46

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

QATAR

Assessment. Staff assesses the 2023 external position to be moderately stronger than the level implied by
fundamentals and desirable policies, based on the External Balance Assessment (EBA-Lite) regression model
that yields a positive CA gap of 2.0 percent of GDP (text table). The REER regression model, which suggests
a negative CA gap (–4.7 percent of GDP), was deemed less suitable for Qatar given its currency peg. Qatar’s
significant reliance on hydrocarbons complicates the application of standard external assessment
methodologies, given the large hydrocarbon price volatility in 2020–22 and more recent export volume
volatility. Some of the volatility is captured by the adjustments for cyclical contributions and conflicts
(0.9 percent and -1.1 percent of GDP, respectively). As the current account surplus is projected to moderate
further in 2024, the CA gap is expected to narrow, aligning the external position more with the level implied
by fundamentals and desirable policies.

Real Exchange Rate
Background. The Riyal has been pegged to the U.S. dollar

rate (NEER) appreciated by 1 percent, similar to the US’s.
Qatar’s real effective exchange rate (REER) weakened by
1 percent in 2023 as the nation’s inflation was below its
trading partners’. In 2024 through November, REER
depreciated somewhat from the same period in 2023.

Capital and Financial Accounts: Flows and Policy Measures
Background. The capital and financial account weakened in 2023. The composition shifted notably. Net
portfolio outflows rose by nearly 10 percentage points of GDP to 15 percent of GDP, driven by portfolio
investments abroad (11 percent of GDP). In contrast, net other investment outflows declined by
16 percentage points to 1 percent of GDP. Overseas investment declined and net reduction in liabilities
mostly by commercial banks following the introduction of QCB measures, moderated. In 2024Q2, net
portfolio outflows abated while net incurrence of other investment liabilities resumed.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

47

QATAR

Assessment. A lack of detailed information on the nature of financial flows complicates the analysis of
Qatar’s financial account. The strong foreign asset position, including the QIA’s estimated sizable assets,
limits risks and vulnerabilities related to capital flows. Declines in commercial banks’ foreign liabilities have
reduced financial stability risks.

FX Intervention and Reserves Level
Background. The large current account surplus only
translated into a moderate increase in central bank
foreign reserves in 2023, by US$4 billion to reach
US$51.5 billion, equivalent to 24 percent of GDP,
7.8 months of prospective imports, 196 percent of
short-term external debt, and an estimated
59 percent of the IMF’s reserve adequacy metric
(ARA, up from 52 percent in 2022)2. Much of the
current account surplus was estimated to have been
invested by the QIA overseas. In 2024H1, foreign
reserve accumulation ($1 billion) remained more
modest than implied by the size of the current
account surplus (US$20 billion).

Assessment. Qatar’s “overall” FX reserve coverage was adequate in 2023. QCB foreign reserves are
complemented by large foreign assets held by the QIA, estimated at 220 percent of GDP in 2023. Together,
they account for about 600 percent of the ARA metric, significantly above the 100 percent adequacy
benchmark.
_____________________________________________________________________________

The authorities face capacity constraints to provide comprehensive IIP data.

The ARA is a composite metric that measures the adequacy of precautionary reserves. It is based on the relative risk weights
for each source of foreign exchange drain drawing on the 10th percentile of observed outflows from emerging market
economies during exchange market pressure episodes. Reserves in the range of 100–150 percent of the composite metric
are considered broadly adequate for precautionary purposes.

Annex III. Nowcasting of Non-hydrocarbon GDP Growth in Qatar
This Annex applies nowcasting, which has been widely used for near-term growth projections, to
Qatar’s real non-hydrocarbon output growth, with several innovations. Results fit historical data well
and point to a gradual recovery from the post-World Cup growth trough. A few caveats related to the
machine-learning approach for nowcasting are also discussed.
1.
Nowcasting generates real-time forecasts for key economic indicators where the
official data may be unavailable or delayed by analyzing high-frequency macroeconomic
indicators. For example, Qatar publishes GDP data with a lag of around 2-3 quarters, while policy
makers and businesses may need a more timely

business decisions—nowcasting is an effective
tool to fill the gap. This technique is particularly
suitable where high-frequency indicators are
abundant and published timely, as in the case of
Qatar. Nowcasting models are also highly
adaptable—they can be updated regularly with
new data, ensuring that the estimates remain

relevant and accurate amidst changing
economic conditions.
2.
A nowcasting model for Qatar’s non-hydrocarbon economy is developed, based on
previous IMF work (Barhoumi, Karim, et al. 2022, Akbal, Faruk, et al. 2023), following the steps
below:
•

Select predictive variables. A wide range of economic and financial indicators are selected to
capture domestic, regional and global conditions that could affect Qatar’s non-hydrocarbon
economy. These variables are chosen based on criteria such as predictive power (i.e., suggested
by the pairwise correlation between the predictive variable and Qatar’s non-hydrocarbon GDP),
data availability, and minimal lag time. A balance is maintained between the number of
predictors and the size of the training data (used to fit nowcasting models with historical trends)
to avoid overfitting – a situation where the model is too "tailored" to the training data and fails
to generalize to other situations, leading to inaccurate predictions.

•

Select nowcasting models. The selected time series data are processed through advanced
machine learning algorithms (see below). A variety of models, including Support Vector
Machines (SVMs), Random Forests, and Elastic Net, are trained by historical data. Each model's
performance is evaluated using a range of metrics (e.g., out-of-sample root-mean-squared error
(RMSE)), and the best-performing models are selected for further analysis.

•

Identify contributions of predictive variables. Shapley decomposition is applied to break
down the contribution of each variable to the nowcast results. This method allows us to pinpoint

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

49

QATAR

which variables have the most significant impact on the model's predictions. By identifying the
key drivers, we can refine and iterate on the model to improve accuracy and reliability over time.
Figure III. 2. Qatar: Project Overview

Source: IMF staff.

3.
A few innovations have been introduced to Qatar’s nowcasting framework to optimize
the variable and model selections:
•

A big data approach in variable selection is developed to enhance the coverage of potential
predictors of economic growth and reduces the lag between real-world events and nowcasts.
Unlike traditional methods that select variables based on specific economic theories, this
approach collects a large number of variables including those that are unconventional in
economic analysis, and evaluates their correlations with Qatar’s non-hydrocarbon GDP.
Specifically, a Stata program is developed to scrape the Haver and CEIC databases, identifying
relevant keywords in millions of data series. The keywords target data specific to Qatar and its
key trading partners. The program chooses 1,300 Qatar-specific series and 1,200 series related
to Qatar’s trading partners for further selection. For the 2,500 variables, pairwise correlations are
run against Qatar’s non-hydrocarbon GDP. Those with the highest correlations (both positive
and negative) are kept. Judgement based on economic theories and knowledge of the Qatari
economy is then applied to ensure balanced sectoral coverage, narrowing the final pool to
13 variables. Further refinements of variable selection can be done by conducting Shapley
decomposition of nowcasting results to identify contributions from different predicative
variables and iterate with alternative variables.

•

Machine learning (ML) models are applied to handle large and complex datasets. Unlike
traditional methods such as statistical models and surveys, ML models allow for better
integration of complex, non-linear relationships between economic variables that ARIMA models
might miss due to their linear structure and reliance on smaller, time-series data. ML models can
also adapt to changing patterns in data more efficiently than statistical models. They can learn
from outliers, non-stationarity, and other irregularities, potentially yielding more accurate and
timelier GDP nowcasts.

to those for regional peers (see Korniyenko et
al, 2023). Figure 5 shows the overall fit of the

gradual recovery from the post-World Cup
growth trough. Table 1 provides a list of variables used in the final Qatar model. Nine of the
variables are Qatar-specific, covering the real sector (e.g., inflation and oil activities), external sector
(e.g., export oil price to China), and financial sector (e.g., 3-month deposit rate and credit facilities).
The remaining 4 series capture economic activities in Qatar’s key trading partners.

While a useful tool, the ML-based nowcasting framework comes with caveats. ML
models are primarily focused on identifying statistical patterns in the dataset. The variable and
model selections aim to maximize predictive power, and the results (including contributions from
variables) should not be interpreted in the same way as in regression analysis, which is usually based
on economic theories.

The overall risk of sovereign stress is low, reflecting a low level of
vulnerability in the near, medium, and long term.

Near term 1/

Near-term risks are assessed as low consistent with the mechanical

commitment to, and the recent track record of, fiscal discipline support a
strong fiscal position and the projected reduction in the debt ratio.

Medium term

Comments

Long-term risks are low supported by the QIA’s large financial assets,
manageable aging-related and social security expenditures, and strong
natural gas reserves. As the cleanest fossil fuel, natural gas will likely
play a key role for a smoother energy transition relative to fossil fuels
with higher emission. Qatar's production cost is low. These together
support sizeable revenues over a long term.

DSA Summary Assessment

Commentary: Qatar is at a low overall risk of sovereign stress. Hydrocarbon prices are set to remain relatively high and commitmen
to, and the recent track record of, fiscal discipline support low fiscal and debt risk. The large reserves of natural gas, cleaner than
other browner fossil fuels, is likely to play a key role in a smoother energy transition, and strong financial buffers (including from the
sovereign wealth fund, QIA) can provide support if downside risks materialize. The projected non-hydrocarbon primary balance
(NHPB) is broadly consistent with the benchmark guided by the Permanent Income Hypothesis (PIH) in the long term (see the main
text of the Staff Report). The authorities are in the process of producing own actuarial studies on the sustainability of the pension
system.

Source: Fund staff.
Note: The risk of sovereign stress is a broader concept than debt sustainability. Unsustainable debt can only be resolved through exceptional measures (such as debt
restructuring). In contrast, a sovereign can face stress without its debt necessarily being unsustainable, and there can be various measures—that do not involve a debt
restructuring—to remedy such a situation, such as fiscal adjustment and new financing.
1/ The near-term assessment is not applicable in cases where there is a disbursing IMF arrangement. In surveillance-only cases or in cases with precautionary IMF
arrangements, the near-term assessment is performed but not published.
2/ A debt sustainability assessment is optional for surveillance-only cases and mandatory in cases where there is a Fund arrangement. The mechanical signal of the debt
sustainability assessment is deleted before publication. In surveillance-only cases or cases with IMF arrangements with normal access, the qualifier indicating probability of
sustainable debt (""with high probability"" or ""but not with high probability"") is deleted before publication.

3/ Insurance, Pension, and Standardized Guarantee Schemes, typically including government employee pension liabilities.
4/ Includes accrual recording, commitment basis, due for payment, etc.
5/ Nominal value at any moment in time is the amount the debtor owes to the creditor. It reflects the value of the instrument at creation and subsequent
economic flows (such as transactions, exchange rate, and other valuation changes other than market price changes, and other volume changes).
6/ The face value of a debt instrument is the undiscounted amount of principal to be paid at (or before) maturity.
7/ Market value of debt instruments is the value as if they were acquired in market transactions on the balance sheet reporting date (reference date). Only
traded debt securities have observed market values.
Commentary: The fiscal data cover the central government. Staff continues to encourage the authorities that the coverage be expanded to include the broader public
sector and the QIA.

Commentary: Staff assesses that risks related to large amortization are low, consistent with the mechanical overall risk indication. The baseline
path suggests that the debt ratio would remain low and stable, consistent with staff's separate analysis of the PIH benchmark to ensure
intergenerational equity in the long run, discussed in the main text of this Staff Report.

Annex V. Risk Assessment Matrix 1
Source of Risk and Likelihood

Expected Impact if Risk is Realized

High

Global Risks
Medium

Policy Response

Intensification of regional conflict(s).
Escalation or spread of the conflict in Gaza
and Israel, Russia’s war in Ukraine, and/or
other regional conflicts or terrorism disrupt
trade (e.g., energy, food, tourism, supply
chains), remittances, FDI and financial flows,
and payment systems, and lead to refugee
flows.

The impact would depend on the nature of the
event. The shock could translate into higher global
hydrocarbon prices, but there is also the risk of LNG
export disruption—the overall impact on Qatar is
highly uncertain. Intensification of regional
conflict(s) could also weaken investor confidence
and disrupt supply chain, tourism, and capital flows.

Commodity price volatility. Supply and
demand fluctuations (e.g., due to conflicts,
export restrictions, OPEC+ decisions, and
green transition) cause recurrent
commodity price volatility, external and
fiscal pressures and food insecurity in
EMDEs, cross-border spillovers, and social
and economic instability.

Qatar’s ongoing LNG production expansion will
raise the economy’s sensitivity to energy price
volatility. Higher-than-projected energy prices could
strengthen fiscal and external positions, and nonhydrocarbon output growth as ample hydrocarbon
liquidity and positive private sector confidence
could boost consumption and investment. Pressures
to increase public spending could rise. Lower oil
prices would weaken the external and fiscal
balances, and growth.

The authorities should implement a mediumterm fiscal framework which helps insulate
public spending from oil price volatility.
Diversifying the revenue base toward more
non-hydrocarbon sources would reduce
revenue sensitivity to energy price volatility.
Accelerate structural reforms to advance
economic diversification.

Global growth downside surprise. Growth
slowdown in major economies, including
due to supply disruptions, tight monetary
policy, rising corporate bankruptcies, or a
deeper-than-envisaged real estate sector
contraction, with adverse spillovers through
trade and financial channels, triggering
sudden stops in some EMDEs. (Low
probability is assigned to surprise
acceleration in global growth).

Lower external demand reduces hydrocarbon export
prices, weakening fiscal and external positions which
are currently strong. Slower global growth would
also weigh on domestic growth, affecting banking
sector asset quality. Global financial market
corrections may lead to capital outflows and
increase financial stability risks, including due to
banks’ still sizeable exposure to foreign funding.

Qatar has fiscal space to respond to a major
growth slowdown. Fiscal policy should be
anchored in a medium-term framework to
reduce the risk of procyclicality. Continue to
closely monitor banking sector developments
to maintain financial stability. Accelerate
structural reforms to boost economic
diversification and non-hydrocarbon
potential output.

Monetary policy calibration. Amid
elevated uncertainty and data surprises,
monetary policy stances in major countries
turn out to be too loose, hindering
disinflation, or too tight for too long than
warranted, stifling growth domestically and
globally, and increasing capital flow and
exchange rate volatility in EMDEs.

Consistent with the exchange rate peg, monetary
policy in Qatar would closely follow that of the U.S.
As domestic inflationary pressure remains low and
growth continues to normalize from the World Cupdriven boom, the risk that a too loose monetary
stance could de-anchor inflation expectations is
limited. On the other hand, a monetary stance too
tight for too long than warranted could negatively
affect demand, but the ongoing public investment
and spillovers from the North Field LNG expansion
will support growth.

High

Medium

Medium

Medium
Systemic financial instability. High interest
rates and risk premia, and sudden asset
repricing amid economic slowdowns and
policy uncertainty (including from elections)
trigger market dislocations, with crossborder spillovers and an adverse macrofinancial feedback loop putting weak banks
and NBFIs under pressure.

High

Medium

Low

Low
Tighter global financial conditions would increase
debt service and financing costs, and increase the
liquidity risk for domestic banks reliant on foreign
funding as banks’ net foreign liabilities remain
relatively high. Such risks are however mitigated by
Qatar’s large financial buffers, favorable market
access, high sovereign credit ratings, and banks’
reduced exposure to nonresident deposits.

The policy response would depend on the
nature of the shock. Qatar has fiscal space to
respond to a negative shock. The central
bank should provide adequate liquidity in the
banking system if needed. Continue to
closely monitor financial institutions.

Maintain monetary policy and liquidity
management that are consistent with the
currency peg. Continue to closely monitor
banking sector developments to ensure
financial stability. If growth is negatively
affected by unduly tight (imported) monetary
policy stance, some fiscal space could be
deployed to provide targeted support while
maintaining broad fiscal prudence.

Maintain prudent financial sector policy and
closely monitor risks and vulnerabilities
related to financial institutions, including
through stress tests and thematic inspections.
Provide liquidity to the financial system if
needed, compatible with the currency peg.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path. The relative likelihood is the staff’s
subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a
probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the
source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may
interact and materialize jointly.

QATAR
Source of Risk and Likelihood
High

Expected Impact if Risk is Realized
Medium

Deepening geoeconomic fragmentation.
Broader conflicts, inward-oriented policies,
and weakened international cooperation
result in a less efficient configuration of
trade and FDI, supply disruptions,
protectionism, policy uncertainty,
technological and payments systems
fragmentation, rising shipping and input
costs, financial instability, a fracturing of
international monetary system, and lower
growth.

Supply disruptions and higher input costs would
accelerate inflation. Lower FDI and trade would
dampen output growth and the pace of economic
diversification. The fiscal and external accounts
would benefit if the price of and demand for the
nation’s natural gas strengthen.

Cyberthreats. Cyberattacks on physical or
digital infrastructure (including digital
currency and crypto assets), technical
failures, or misuse of AI technologies trigger
financial and economic instability.

As the nation continues to enhance its global
visibility and digitalization, cyberthreats have
reportedly increased significantly. Cyberattacks
would, for instance, lead to financial losses for
individuals and businesses, the theft of sensitive
information, and disruptions in key operations
(businesses, transportation, or power).

High

Medium

Climate change. Extreme climate events
driven by rising temperatures cause loss of
life, damage to infrastructure, food
insecurity, supply disruptions, lower growth,
and financial instability. A disorderly
transition to net-zero emissions and
regulatory uncertainty lead to stranded
assets and low investment.

Medium

Real estate market weakness. Property
prices remain weak amid oversupply,
negatively affecting the banking system and
the broader economy.

Medium

Uncertainty surrounding the
implementation of the Third National
Development Strategy. Risks are two
sided. On the upside, implementation could
be faster, more efficient, and better
coordinated than expected. On the
downside, insufficient coordination and
implementation capacity could lead to
resource misallocation and slower progress.

Policy Response

Global Risks

Medium

High

Qatar’s ecosystem is highly vulnerable to climate
shocks. Climate stressors have a significant impact
on water, temperature, and sea level. With limited
water resources and increasing temperatures,
adaptation costs are likely to increase rapidly.
Extreme climate events in partner countries could
affect Qatar. A disorderly energy transition could
affect Qatar’s hydrocarbon revenue and hence the
fiscal and external positions.

Domestic Risks
Medium

Bank asset quality could weaken, and the
construction sector would come under pressure,
potentially dampening credit and non-hydrocarbon
output growth. On the other hand, banks’ exposure
to the real estate market is well provisioned. Policy
measures were also introduced in 2023 to monitor
and mitigate risks associated with the real estate
market.
Medium

Faster-than-expected implementation would boost
medium-term growth more than envisaged. Slowerthan-expected implementation would result in
weaker-than-envisaged output gains. Resource
misallocation would also entail larger fiscal costs.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Accelerate fiscal and structural reforms to
boost potential non-hydrocarbon output
growth, economic diversification, and private
investment. Provide targeted support to the
most vulnerable against higher inflation.
Maintain prudent financial sector policy to
ensure financial stability.

Qatar has expanded its capacity to contain
cyberthreats by creating the National
Cybersecurity Agency in 2021. A National
Cybersecurity Strategy 2024-30 has been
launched in September 2024 to further
enhance legislation, coordinate with the ICT
sector, and strike a balance between ensuring
cybersecurity and promoting innovation.
Effective implementation of the strategy, and
continued close monitoring and supervision
including of the banking and payment
systems are key.
In line with Qatar National Vision 2030,
continue working on various initiatives,
including renewable energy, green building
practices, sustainable transportation, and
education and awareness campaigns. The
Climate Change Action Plan identifies a
number of mitigation and adaptation
measures across various sectors (healthcare,
biodiversity, water management and
infrastructure) to ensure the implementation
the National Environment and Climate
Change Strategy and the achievement of key
goals including 25 percent reduction in GHG
emissions by 2030.

Leverage the ongoing effort to step up
surveillance of the property sector. Monitor
risks to the banking sector closely and
recognize NPLs promptly. Maintain strong
banking sector capital buffers, liquidity and
provisioning to mitigate the impact.
Formalize financial safety net. Qatar has fiscal
space to help contain threat to
macroeconomic and financial stability.
Properly sequence reforms and enhance
inter-agency coordination to ensure
appropriate resource allocation and smooth
implementation. Regularly monitor and
assess progress relative to benchmarks,
reassess risks, and recalibrate implementation
plans as needed, leveraging the newly
established National Planning Council.

Annex VI. Implementation of the 2023 Article IV Recommendations
Recommendations
Fiscal Policy
The medium-term fiscal strategy should
balance sustained fiscal prudence and
transformation to a private sector-led
economy.
Accelerate revenue diversification,
including via VAT introduction and CIT
broadening.
Rationalize wage bill and continue
subsidy reforms.
Establish a well-designed medium-term
fiscal framework and enhance
transparency.
Monetary and Financial Sector Policy
Strengthen liquidity forecasting and
management.
Contain banks' exposure to foreign
liabilities.
Continue strengthening efforts to
enhance banking sector resilience.
Carefully balance opportunities and
risks around fintech and green financing
initiatives with adequate regulations.
Implement the FATF action plan in a
decisive and coordinated manner.
Structural Reforms and Statistics
Focus further reforms on productivity,
business environment, digitalization,
and climate actions.
Enhance macroeconomic statistics by
improving data quality, coverage, and
timeliness, and by strengthening the
institutional framework for statistics.

Status
Broad fiscal prudence has been maintained and is expected to be
upheld. The authorities plan to align spending with reform priorities in
line with NDS3, including towards building climate resilience and
human capital.
Recognizing the importance of mobilizing non-hydrocarbon revenues,
the authorities preferred to introduce the VAT and other revenue
diversification measures when domestic/global growth are more robust.
Preparation for the implementation of the global minimum CIT is
underway—its introduction is expected to be at the beginning of 2025.
Efforts are ongoing to introduce program-based budgeting, and the
expenditure review program to enhance efficiency is underway.
Qatar’s updated medium-term budget covers a 5-year period for the
first time to support NDS3 implementation.
The QCB has continued to improve liquidity management through T-bill
issuance. A recent IMF technical assistance provided a series of
recommendations which the QCB is considering.
A series of QCB measures have helped reduce banks’ short-term foreign
asset-liability mismatches. A comprehensive Third Financial Sector
Strategy was published, with plans to deepen domestic financial market
which would help boost banks’ domestic funding.
Financial safety net (deposit insurance, recover/resolution framework) is
being enhanced with IMF technical assistance. Measures to limit risks
from the real estate sector have been introduced.
A number of related areas are articulated in the Third Financial Sector
Strategy. Fintech sandboxes provide a controlled environment. The
digital asset framework establishes a legal and regulatory foundation.
The authorities have submitted an action plan to implement FATF
recommendations. A recent IMF diagnostic mission identified TA needs
and initiated a 2-year work program to strengthen the effectiveness of
the AML/CFT framework.
Reforms are being intensified guided by the Third National
Development Strategy (NDS3) released in January 2024, which provides
an ambitious reform agenda to enhance human capital, productivity,
business environment, and climate resilience.
The National Planning Council (NPC) took over the former Planning and
Statistics Authority (PSA) in May 2024. The National Statistics Center is
established under NPC to strengthen statistics. Comprehensive data
coverage on the external financial account and the International
Investment Position remains a challenge, highlighted by Qatar's
absence from surveys on CPIS and CDIS.

The data provided to the Fund is adequate for surveillance.
The data provided to the Fund has some shortcomings but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
The data provided to the Fund has some shortcomings that somewhat hamper surveillance.
The data provided to the Fund has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance.

Rationale for staff assessment. Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance but with shortcomings. Data frequency, timeliness and coverage should be improved.
National accounts. Data sources used to compile quarterly estimates of GDP at current and constant prices need to be broadened to enhance accuracy. GDP by
expenditure needs to be more up to date–by component annual data lag the headline (in current prices) or are available only up to 2018 (in constant prices). For the latter,
the quarterly data should also provide a breakdown (only the headline number is produced). Timeliness was an issue also for GDP by activity data (2023Q4 GDP data were
released in early-September 2024. 2024Q1–Q2 GDP data were released in early-December 2024 and 2024Q3 GDP data at end-December 2024).
Prices. Monthly Consumer and Producer Price Indices (CPI, PPI), and real estate price data are published timely. CPI weights need to be updated more frequently. The
Ministry of Justice publishes Weekly Newsletter with daily property transaction data by type which can benefit from greater consistency to better inform surveillance.
Government finance. The authorities are implementing the Government Financial Management Information System (GFMIS) which enables compilation of accrual fiscal
accounts. An IMF Technical Assistance (TA) mission in 2019 supported transition to the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014. Transparency was enhanced by the
publication of annual budget documents and quarterly budget performance reports for the central government with headline budget and debt numbers––the reports
could include more line items and quarterly debt numbers. The prospectus for sovereign euro bond issuance includes detailed information on revenue and expenditure line
items, and external bonds, but publication is infrequent. For the 2023 budget, a press release was published and, instead of the regular budget statement, the Minister
provided relevant information at the press conference. The format of the 2024 budget statement was similar to the 2023 budget press release. The coverage of financial
operations should be broadened to the general government including the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA).
External sector. The Qatar Central Bank (QCB) reports quarterly balance of payments data timely, following the fifth edition of the balance of payments manual (BPM5).
The financial account has been developed and coverage improved for major public corporations, the Qatar Financial Center Authority, and the Qatar Stock Exchange.
However, financial account data are aggregated. The authorities need to improve coordination to enhance the coverage of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flow data (which
deviate significantly from FDI commitment data). A 2017 TA mission helped develop a quarterly survey for nonfinancial sector data aimed at producing a quarterly
International Investment Position (IIP) statement. However, following the TA the authorities have continued to face capacity constraints in providing comprehensive IIP data
to the IMF. More work is needed to ensure comprehensive data coverage, collection, and granularity—efforts should strengthen to allow Qatar's participation in key
surveys like the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) and the Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS).
Monetary and financial sectors. The QCB submits the monetary and financial statistics (MFS) for the central bank and other depository corporations based on the
Standardized Report Forms (SRFs). The MFS data are published in the International Financial Statistics on a timely basis. Qatar also reports data on some key series and
indicators of the Financial Access Survey (FAS), including mobile money and the two indicators of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals, but does not report data by
gender. The QCB reports the Financial Soundness Indicators as part of the National Summary Data Page, but does not submit to the IMF, and 4 indicators are missing
relative to the IMF’s list of Core Financial Soundness indicators.
Changes since the last Article IV consultation. The Planning and Statics Authority was replaced by a newly established National Planning Council to strengthen reform
implementation stipulated in the Third National Development Strategy, including to improve statistics. The statistics authority is in the process of producing new supply
and use tables to improve the consistency of GDP estimates. A household survey is being finalized, which will be used to update CPI weights. The domestic “FDI ecosystem”
has been fully mapped to identify additional sources of input data including business registration platforms (i.e., QFC, QSTP, QFZA, Media city) which will increase survey
frame from current 130+ entities to 2000+ entities.
Corrective actions and capacity development priorities. Enhance awareness across government entities of the data gaps and international best practices. Implement
recommendations made by the above-mentioned TAs. Encourage the authorities to seek the Institute for Capacity Development (ICD) training, additional Statistics
Departments (STA) TAs, and participate in the workshop on the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) to be organized by the newly established Riyadh Regional
Office. Urge the National Planning Council and National Statistics Center to coordinate efforts across relevant government entities on statistics including consolidation of
scattered data, submission to the IMF, and broader publication.
Use of data and/or estimates different from official statistics in the Article IV consultation. IIP data are unavailable, including QIA’s assets under management. Staff
rely on different data sources as needed––it estimates external debt data (for non-bank private sector and public sector debt outside of the central government), uses
alternative data sources for FDI, and relies on commercially available bank-level data.
Other data gaps. A more granular forward-looking calendar of key data releases would aid surveillance and enhance transparency. By maturity assets and liabilities data
and by sector non-performing loans (NPLs) data will enhance the assessment of banking sector risks for surveillance. Data on enterprises, particularly small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs), and on climate change adaptation and mitigation would help inform surveillance.

Exchange Rate Arrangement
The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements in Qatar are conventional pegged
arrangements against the U.S. dollar. The Qatari riyal has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at
QR3.64 per U.S. dollar since July 2001, following an unofficial peg since June 1980. Qatar has
accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3 and 4 of the IMF’s Articles of
Agreement, and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions and multiple currency practices.
Qatar maintains exchange restrictions for security reasons, based on UN Security Council
Resolutions, that have been notified to the Fund for approval under the procedures set forth in
Executive Board Decision No. 144 (52/51).

Last Article IV Consultation
The discussions for the previous Article IV consultation were held during November 1–14, 2023.
The staff report was considered by the Executive Board on January 11, 2024, and published on
February 7, 2024.
FSAP and ROSC Participation
FSAP missions were conducted in 2007. LEG conducted the 2007 assessment of the AML/CFT
framework and provided comprehensive technical assistance (TA) in 2007–11. The 2023 mutual
evaluation by the Financial Action Task Force highlighted both substantive improvements made so
far and areas for some major improvements going forward. LEG initiated TA to assist Qatar in
further enhancing the effectiveness of the framework, focusing on strengthening risk-based
supervision of non-financial businesses and professions (e.g., precious metals and stones, real
estate), making beneficial ownership information available and easily accessible, and providing
training to key AML/CFT agencies.

Statement by Mohamed Maait, Executive Director for Qatar, and Mira Merhi,
Advisor to Executive Director
January 27, 2025
On behalf of the Qatari authorities, we would like to extend our sincere gratitude to the Staff mission team for the
constructive discussions during the recent Article IV consultation.
Economic Developments and Outlook
Underpinned by its long-term strategic diversification plan “the Qatar National Vision 2030”, the Qatar economic
transformation is thriving, and substantial strides have been made in economic, human, social, environmental, and
institutional development. After a very strong economic performance in 2022, boosted by the successful hosting of
the 2022 FIFA World Cup, output growth has normalized in 2023 and 2024, with recent signs of economic activities
strengthening at the end of 2024, notably in the tourism sector. Qatar's inflation has been generally declining
throughout 2023 and 2024. The medium-term outlook is positive, bolstered by massive LNG production expansion
and by reform efforts which are expected to intensify under the upcoming Third National Development Strategy as
well as under the Third Financial Sector Strategy (3FSS) which is also expected to provide impetus for a sustainable
growth. Qatar’s strong fundamentals and significant policy buffers would help mitigate any negative impact in case
downside risks materialize.
Fiscal Policy
The State of Qatar’s low public debt, significant fiscal and external buffers, and the longer-term benefits and returns
of the authorities’ investment plans for future generation are remarkable. The authorities continue to be fully
committed to a prudent fiscal policy that aim to optimize the use of Qatar’s resources by improving spending
efficiency and mobilizing non-oil revenues, all whilst promoting sustainable growth and preserving
intergenerational equity. The 2024 budget was focused on allocating resources for the third National Development
Strategy (NDS3) and supporting efforts to diversify the economy. The general budget continues to focus on
achieving the goals of Qatar National Vision 2030 related to the development of human capital by focusing on the
health and education sectors – with the allocations for the two sectors constituting 20% of the total budget - in
addition to the goals related to diversifying the local economy and enhancing its competitiveness.
The authorities are committed to a sustainable, shock-resistant medium-term fiscal framework supported by
diversified revenues, efficient expenditures, and relatively low debt. Key 2030 targets include to reach a fiscal
surplus of 5½ percent of GDP (way above the past five-year-average of 3 percent), maintain the current sovereign
credit ratings of AA/Aa2 with stable outlook, and achieve manageable expenditure growth. The government plans
to reduce procyclicality of spending, implement program-based budgeting, and enhance debt management through
frameworks including sovereign green financing. The authorities intend to continue addressing underlying spending
inefficiencies and diversify fiscal revenues notably through implementing the corporate income tax Pillar II in line
with the global timeline. The 2025 budget envisages broadly prudent spending plans and aims for a medium-term
expenditure-based fiscal consolidation. The authorities have made good progress in expanding program-based
budgeting to eventually cover all sectors by the end of 2025 and expect that the ongoing expenditure review would
generate savings in the medium term. Moreover, the authorities plan to enhance their macroeconomic projections
to support the medium-term budget update. The authorities view the fiscal risks from ongoing PPPs, mainly on
operating and maintaining existing infrastructure, to be minimal.

Monetary and Financial Sector Policies
The Central Bank of Qatar (QCB) continues to skillfully manage monetary and financial policies, preserving
macroeconomic and financial stability and promoting sustainable growth. The authorities agree with staff’s
assessment that the exchange rate peg continues to serve the Qatari economy well. They appreciated the IMF
technical Assistance on liquidity management and plan to progressively implement its recommendations. The QCB
aims to further improve the effectiveness of monetary policy operational framework as a medium-term objective.
Qatar’s banking sector is healthy, with strong capital buffers, sound liquidity and stable profitability. Furthermore,
QCB maintains a robust regulatory framework and conducts effective supervision to ensure the health of the sector
and to preempt any potential risks to financial stability. The QCB is committed to regular risk reassessment and the
newly introduced risk-based supervision strengthened the assessment of emerging risks and early action. Banks are
well prepared to manage legacy real estate sector weaknesses and the recent macroprudential measures were
effectively implemented to address potential risks. The micro and macroprudential measures, including the countercyclical capital buffer, are periodically reviewed, and would be dynamically adjusted to manage emerging risks.
Moving forward, developments in Qatar’s financial sector will be further supported by the Third Financial Sector
Strategy (3FSS) covering the period 2023-2030. The strategy will be focusing on governance and regulatory
oversight; Islamic finance; digital innovation and advanced technologies; ESG and sustainability; and talent and
capabilities, with the aim to create vibrant financial and capital markets that lead the region in innovation, efficiency,
and investor protection. “Based on a four-pillar approach - banking, insurance, digital finance, and capital markets
- the Strategy provides a roadmap for the financial sector in Qatar to unlock its full potential in line with Qatar
National Vision (QNV) 2030.
Qatar has made excellent progress in fighting financial crimes, as acknowledged by the 2023 AML/CFT mutual
evaluation report by FATF which highlighted the strength in preventing financial crimes and law enforcement
through improved risk assessment capacity and clearer policy priorities. The QCB has also banned financial
institutions to use crypto assets. The authorities remain firmly committed to strengthening the AML/CFT framework
in alignment with global standards, with a focus on risk-based supervision and effective enforcement to uphold
financial integrity and resilience.
Structural Reforms
The Third National Development Strategy (NDS3) 2024-2030 marks the final phase of the Qatar National Vision
2030. Since launching the National Vision in 2008, Qatar has made significant strides by leveraging energy sector
revenues to build world-class infrastructure and institutions. As a result, Qatar’s nonhydrocarbon economy has
grown to account for about two-thirds of the total output, which underscores Qatar’s commitment to long-term
economic diversification.
The NDS3, launched in January 2024, aims to achieve sustainable economic growth, establish a sustainable
medium-term general budget framework with healthy levels of debt, provide a high standard of living to Qataris
and position Qatar as a global destination. The strategy also aims at boosting human capital and innovation,
enhancing the business environment, attracting FDI and promoting exports. The establishment of the National
Planning Council will have a significant role in prioritizing reforms, ensuring inter-agency coordination, and
monitoring progress.
The authorities have recently launched the Qatar National Manufacturing Strategy for 2024-2030 aiming to drive
sustainable economic development, diversify key economic sectors, boost private sector participation and
contributions, advance manufacturing capabilities and strengthen Qatar’s economic competitiveness in regional and
global markets, in line with the Qatar National Vision 2030. Additionally, Qatar is targeting USD 100 billion in
foreign direct investment by 2030, while creating an investment climate that will establish Qatar as a leading

innovation hub and preferred investment destination, both regionally and globally. Moreover, Qatar is prioritizing
the information technology sector, and is well placed to leverage AI for productivity gain and has a comparative
advantage in energy cost and reliability to attract data centers. The recent launch of the National Health Strategy
2024-2030 will also further reinforce the goals of NDS3.
The authorities are on track to meet their 2030 climate targets. Furthermore, the Ministry of Environment and
Climate Change has launched its 2024 – 2030 Strategy aiming to support environmental sustainability, enhance
Qatar’s ability to adapt to climate change, protect the environment and conserve its natural resources. The strategy
will advance sustainable environmental practices while supporting research, innovation, and digital transformation,
and strengthening the environmental legislation and policies. Reflecting Qatar’s national targets and its commitment
to environmental sustainability, the strategy includes a 25% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, the
restoration of 30% of affected natural habitats, the protection of 30% of land and coastal areas and the conservation
of 17 endangered and endemic species to preserve biodiversity.
The authorities recognize that reliable and timely economic data are essential for effective policymaking and reform
implementation. To this end, they are actively working to strengthen data quality and coverage to facilitate wellinformed decision-making.
Conclusion
Through prudent policies, sound fiscal and monetary management, and ambitious reforms, the State of Qatar has
well-positioned itself to achieve its long-term economic National Vision 2030 and to further strengthen its
prominent position within the global economy.
